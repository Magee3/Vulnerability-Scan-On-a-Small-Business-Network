           As you can see our business environment contains 13 major vulnerabilities. The page shows 14 because our first Vulnerability
           is that our Greenbone Assistant is outdated (we are using a trial version). You can inspect each vulnerability. They
           show a name, summary, detection result, insight, impact, severity, a solution, and other refreneces. This is a quick and easy way 
           to anaylze an environment to make neccesary patches. You can also prepare for attacks, create risk assessments, and many more
           to ensure that the network is secured.

           The last step would be to document all of the scans findings in a report and send it up to your Senior Engineer.
